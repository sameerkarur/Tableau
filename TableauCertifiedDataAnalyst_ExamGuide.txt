Scoring
Scoring Insight
Please keep in mind that your final score is based on the number of questions answered or tasks performed
correctly. If you leave a question unanswered or a lab task not performed, you will not receive credit.
Furthermore, you do not receive partial credit. For example, if a question requires you to select three
correct options, you do not receive credit for selecting one or two of the three options that are correct. Also,
for lab tasks, there may be multiple ways to perform the task correctly. You are only graded on whether or
not all of the requirements are met in your final response.

Scaled Scoring
Scaled scores are a mathematical conversion of the number of items that a candidate answers correctly so
that there is a consistent scale used across all forms of the exam. A relevant example is the process of
converting pounds to kilograms. The weight of the object has not changed, only the units being reported.
Tableau exam results are reported as a score from 100 to 1000. The score shows how the candidate
performed on the examination as a whole and the pass or fail designation. Scaled scoring models are used
to equate scores across multiple exam forms that may have slightly different difficulty levels.
Score reports are sent when a candidate fails the exam. This report contains a table of categories of
performance at each section level. This information is designed to provide general feedback concerning
examination performance. The examination uses a compensatory scoring model, which means candidates
do not need to “pass” the individual sections, only the overall examination. Each section of the
examination has a specific weighting, some sections have more questions than others. The scoring table
contains general information, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. Section level feedback should be
interpreted with candidate caution and paired with other available forms of remediation before retaking
the exam.

Unscored Content
This examination includes unscored items. These items are placed on the exam to gather statistical
information to verify their validity for future use. These items are not identified on the exam and do not
affect the scoring of the exam.

Exam Structure
The Tableau Certified Data Analyst exam has 3 sections. The first section is knowledge-based with a variety
of item types, but no hands-on questions. The second section of the exam is the hands-on lab. This section
requires the candidate to demonstrate their skills using Tableau. The third section resembles the first
section in testing the candidate's knowledge with a variety of item types, but no hands-on questions.
Candidates are not allowed go back to a previous section of the exam once they have moved on to the next
section. Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, some sections have more questions than others.

Item Types Defined
Knowledge-based: These item types require a single or multiple-selection response.
Multiple Choice: Candidates can select only one answer option.
Multiple Response: Candidates can select two or more answer options.
Active screen: Active Screen items incorporate interactive user interface elements, such as drop-down
lists, checkboxes, option buttons, and drag-and-drop functionality. Candidates select answers using
these elements. A video tutorial and demonstration of active screen item types can be viewed here.
Build list: Build List items evaluate a candidate’s ability to rank a list of items or order a series of
tasks. Candidates are given a split screen with a list of options in the left column and an answer
space in the right column. Using arrow buttons, candidates select options in the left column and
sort them in the right column. Each option can only be used one time.
Drag and drop: Evaluate object association and placement skills with the Drag-and-Drop item
type. Candidates select and reposition answer options within a list or graphic. Candidates drag
elements (answer options) from the left side of the screen into appropriate positions in the
right side of the screen (Answer Area).
Hot area: Hot Area items evaluate a candidate’s ability to locate correct regions on an image.
Candidates are presented with an image. They submit an answer to the item by selecting specific
locations on the image. These locations are activated by “hot area objects.”
Performance-based: Candidates will work in a lab environment using Tableau to complete hands-on tasks.
Responses are automatically graded within the lab. A video tutorial and demonstration of the hands-on lab
item types can be viewed here.

Splitter bar: In some special item type presentations – there is a “splitter bar” between the item and the
answer area. Clicking on the splitter bar, changes the bar highlight to orange and allows candidates to drag the
bar – making the viewing area larger when the candidate chooses.

Additional Exam Details
Access to Materials, Applications, or Internet
Exam items in the first and third sections are written at a recall or understand/apply level. These parts of
the exam are administered without access to the Tableau Platform. The second, hands-on lab section of
the exam requires the candidate to use the Tableau Platform to perform the required tasks. Candidates will
have access to the .pdf version of Tableau Help during this section of the exam. Access to the internet, or
any other outside application is prohibited during the entire exam.

Comments
Candidates are encouraged to comment on items in the exam. Feedback from all comments is considered
when item performance is reviewed prior to the release of new versions of exam content.

Timeliness
Completing a task effectively and efficiently has become a standard that organizations expect from
employees. This exam is timed as a critical competency of successful candidates.

Technical Issues
If you encounter technical issues during the exam, please contact the proctor. In many cases, the only
course of action the proctor can recommend or take, is to restart the exam. More than one restart may be
needed. However, if you are not seeing a resolution in a timely manner and you feel your results will be
negatively affected or you will not be able to finish the exam, ask the proctor to stop the exam and log a
case with Pearson VUE. Once the exam has been stopped, please follow up with the Tableau Certification
Team at certification@tableau.com to log a case about your experience.

Which formula should you use to get the number of items in the equipment list?
a)

MAX ( [Equipment] )
INCORRECT – When using MAX with a string, a string value, not a numeric value is returned.

b)

COUNT ( [Equipment] )
INCORRECT – COUNT will count each time an equipment is listed, resulting in over-counting

c)

COUNTD ( [Equipment] )
CORRECT – COUNTD counts the distinct number of equipment that appear in the list (which is 3).

d)

COVAR ( [Equipment] )
INCORRECT – COVAR does not apply because it is a measure of how much two variables change
together

e)

ATTR ( [Equipment] )
INCORRECT – ATTR does not apply because it is a test for heterogeneity across the rows in a result
set
