### Basic Questions
1. What is the average exam score for all candidates?
   - Solution: Use Tableau's `AVG` function to calculate the average of the `Exam_Score` field.
   - Steps: Drag the `Exam_Score` field to the Rows shelf and select `Average` from the aggregation options.

2. How can you calculate the pass rate for candidates from each country?
   - Solution: Create a calculated field to determine if a candidate passed.
   - Calculated Field Formula: `IF [Passed] = "Yes" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`
   - Steps: 
     1. Create a new calculated field with the above formula.
     2. Drag `Country` to Columns and the calculated field to Rows.
     3. Set the aggregation to `Average` to get the pass rate.

3. What percentage of candidates have completed training?
   - Solution: Calculate the percentage of candidates who completed training.
   - Calculated Field Formula: `IF [Training_Completed] = "Yes" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`
   - Steps:
     1. Create a calculated field with the formula.
     2. Drag it to the Rows shelf and set the aggregation to `Average`.

4. How is the candidates' experience (in months) distributed?
   - Solution: Use a histogram to visualize the distribution of `Experience_Months`.
   - Steps: Drag `Experience_Months` to Columns and select `Histogram` from the Show Me panel.

5. What is the most preferred exam mode among candidates (Online vs. Onsite)?
   - Solution: Use a bar chart to show the count of candidates preferring `Online` vs. `Onsite`.
   - Steps: Drag `Preferred_Exam_Mode` to Columns and `Number of Records` to Rows.

### Intermediate Questions
6. How do exam scores vary across different product versions?
   - Solution: Use box plots to visualize score distributions across `Product_Version`.
   - Steps: Drag `Product_Version` to Columns and `Exam_Score` to Rows. Select `Box Plot` from the Show Me panel.

7. Which countries have the highest average exam scores?
   - Solution: Use a bar chart to display average `Exam_Score` by `Country`.
   - Steps: Drag `Country` to Columns and `Exam_Score` to Rows. Set aggregation to `Average`.

8. Is there a correlation between candidates' experience and their exam scores?
   - Solution: Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `Experience_Months` and `Exam_Score`.
   - Steps: Drag `Experience_Months` to Columns and `Exam_Score` to Rows. Select `Scatter Plot` from the Show Me panel.

9. How has the pass rate changed over different exam attempt dates?
   - Solution: Use a line chart to show the trend of pass rates over `Exam_Attempt_Date`.
   - Steps: Drag `Exam_Attempt_Date` to Columns and the pass rate calculated field to Rows.

10. Analyze the impact of training completion on exam scores.
    - Solution: Compare average scores of candidates who completed training vs. those who didn't.
    - Steps: Drag `Training_Completed` to Columns and `Exam_Score` to Rows. Set aggregation to `Average`.

### Advanced Questions
11. Can you create a model to predict exam success based on candidate data?
    - Solution: Use Tableau's integration with R or Python to build predictive models.
    - Steps: Connect to R or Python through Tableau's external service connection and apply predictive models.

12. How can candidates be segmented based on their exam scores and experience?
    - Solution: Use clustering techniques in Tableau to segment candidates.
    - Steps: Use the `Cluster` feature in the Analytics pane on `Exam_Score` and `Experience_Months`.

13. What trends can be observed in exam attempts over time?
    - Solution: Use time series analysis to identify trends in exam attempts.
    - Steps: Drag `Exam_Attempt_Date` to Columns and `Number of Records` to Rows. Select `Line Chart`.

14. How do exam scores and pass rates vary geographically?
    - Solution: Use Tableau's map feature to visualize scores by geography.
    - Steps: Drag `Country` to the view and `Exam_Score` to Color.

15. Analyze the relationship between candidates' experience and their preferred exam mode.
    - Solution: Use a heat map to analyze the relationship.
    - Steps: Drag `Experience_Months` to Columns and `Preferred_Exam_Mode` to Rows. Use `Number of Records` for Color.

### Expert Questions
16. Create a calculated field to analyze the success rate for each product version.
    - Solution: Compute success rates for each `Product_Version`.
    - Calculated Field Formula: `IF [Passed] = "Yes" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`
    - Steps: Create a calculated field and use it to calculate success rates.

17. Build an interactive dashboard to explore candidate data dynamically.
    - Solution: Build dashboards with filters and parameters.
    - Steps: Use the Dashboard feature to combine multiple sheets and add interactive filters.

18. Use custom visualizations to represent exam score distributions.
    - Solution: Use Tableau's advanced visualization tools.
    - Steps: Explore custom chart types in the Show Me panel.

19. Integrate R to perform advanced statistical analysis on candidate data.
    - Solution: Use R scripts within Tableau.
    - Steps: Connect to R and use `SCRIPT_REAL` or similar functions for analysis.

20. Use Tableau's integration with Python to apply machine learning models for predicting candidate success.
    - Solution: Integrate Python scripts for predictions.
    - Steps: Connect to Python and use `SCRIPT_REAL` or similar functions for predictions.
