# About the Salesforce Certified Tableau Data Analyst Exam and Program

The Salesforce Certified Tableau Data Analyst certification is intended for individuals who enable stakeholders to make business decisions by understanding the business problem, identifying data to explore for analysis, and delivering actionable insights.

This credential validates core Tableau knowledge and development skills of employees, partners, customers, and freelancers, who need to work with various Tableau products including Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and either Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud.

There are no prerequisites for the exam. Upon successful completion of this exam, candidates are awarded the title of Salesforce Certified Tableau Data Analyst.

## Audience Description: Salesforce Certified Tableau Data Analyst

Candidates for this exam have knowledge of the capabilities of Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and either Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud to:

- Connect to data sources.
- Perform data transformations.
- Explore and analyze data.
- Create meaningful visualizations that answer key business questions.
